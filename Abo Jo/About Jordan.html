            <h3>Location And History:</h3>
            <p>The year 1921 witnessed the announcement of Prince <img src="Jordan map.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="map"/>Abdullah bin Al Hussein, may his soul rest in peace, the establishment of the Emirate of Jordan, which declared its independence on May 25, 1946 under the name "The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan", and His Majesty the founding King Abdullah (I) bin Al Hussein became its constitutional monarch.
The Hashemite Kingdom Jordan in the Middle East is situated east of Palestine (West Bank) and the Jordan River. It is located at the crossroads of the Asian, African, and European continents. Jordan shares international boundaries with Iraq, Palestine (West Bank), Saudi Arabia, and Syria, as well as sea borders with Egypt. The virtually landlocked country has a tiny outlet in the south that borders the Gulf of Aqaba (Red Sea). The nation has a shoreline on the Dead Sea, which is the lowest height on land on Earth at 430.5 meters below sea level.The Arabian Desert covers a large portion of Jordan. The nation has an area of 89,342 km2, making it somewhat smaller than Portugal or the state of Indiana in the United States. </p>
<h3>The Royal Family:</h3>

              <p>The Ruling Monarch His Majesty King Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein - and his family are very popular and much loved. His Majesty has revolutionized the Kingdom via his immense efforts to ensure long-term economic growth and social development aimed at raising the standard of living for all Jordanians.
              His Majesty King Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein was born in Amman on January 30, 1962, as the oldest son of His Majesty the late King Hussein and Her Royal Highness Princess Muna Al Hussein.<img src="Royal family.jpeg" alt="" width="400" height="243" class="royal"/> He received his elementary education at the Islamic Educational College in Amman before moving on to St. Edmund's School in Surrey, England. In the United States of America, he attended Eaglebrook School and Deerfield Academy for his secondary school.
              Her Majesty Queen Rania promotes tolerance, compassion, and the creation of bridges between individuals of different cultures and origins. She is dedicated to strengthening women and communities and has initiated a number of educational programs Without a question, the most gorgeous and trendy Queen on the planet.
              The Hashemite Family's origins may be traced back to the Prophet Abraham and his son, Ishmael. The Hashemite name is derived from Hashem, a grandson of Qusai and the Prophet Mohammad's great-grandfather (peace be upon him). Jordan's Hashemites are consequently direct descendants of the Prophet via his daughter Fatima and her husband Ali.              </p>

              <h3>Population:</h3>
            <p>Jordan is home to 9.9 million people (in 2017, including refugees of the Syrian Civil War). Amman (pop. 1.5 million) is the capital and largest city; around 4 million people reside in Greater Amman Municipality, accounting for nearly half of the country's population. The official language is Arabic, with English as a second language. Jordan has a largely Muslim population; over 92 percent of Jordanians practice Sunni Islam, the country's primary religion. Jordan's southern cities have the largest percentage of Muslim residents. Jordan has some of the world's earliest Christian communities, going back to the first century after Jesus' crucifixion, in the year AD. Christians now make up roughly 4% of the population, down from 20% in 1930, while their absolute number has increased. This is owing to high Muslim immigration rates into Jordan, greater Christian emigration rates to the West, and higher Muslim birth rates. According to a 2014 Orthodox Church estimate, Jordanian Christians number roughly 250,000 and are completely Arabic-speaking. Christians are extremely well incorporated into Jordanian society and have a great deal of freedom.</p></p>

			<h3>Climate:</h3>
			
<p>Jordan's climate varies widely. In general, the further inland from the Mediterranean you go, the higher the temperature disparities and the less rainfall. The average elevation in the country is 812 m (2,664 ft) (SL). The highlands above the Jordan Valley, the mountains of the Dead Sea and Wadi Araba, and as far south as Ras Al-Naqab have a Mediterranean climate, but the country's eastern and northeastern regions are dry desert. Although the desert regions of the kingdom can reach high temperatures, the heat is normally reduced by low humidity and a daily wind, with chilly evenings.
Summers are hot and dry, lasting from May to September, with temperatures average approximately 32 째C (90 째F) and occasionally topping 40 째C (104 째F) during July and August. The winter, which lasts from November to March, is quite mild, with temperatures average approximately 13 degrees Celsius (55 degrees Fahrenheit). Winter also brings regular rains and snowfall in certain western higher locations.
